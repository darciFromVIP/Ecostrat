  description: "You\u2019ve always enjoyed organising events, but it takes more than
    just natural talent. You will need the support of the people with whom you want
    to hold these social events. That\u2019s why you decided to create a stand at
    the places where garbage will be collected. And of course, everyone can buy a
    small snack for their hard work there as well."
