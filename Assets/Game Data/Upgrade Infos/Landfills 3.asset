  description: Our last landfill is starting to raise suspicions about the connection
    to our name, so it's best to burn all the trash and get rid of all evidence of
    our connection. It won't do much good for the atmosphere, but at least we'll
    increase a capacity for the next inflow of waste.
  benefits: +7 trash increment +3 000 trash capacity
