  description: The last part of your puzzle is having control over politics. If you
    want to have utmost control over countries and their laws, you need to control
    the ones who decide about them. ProBribers avoid politics at all costs and you
    need to step up and dive deeper into the options that dark web offers. No names,
    nicknames, nothing. Communication via head-to-head meetings, because online messages
    and calls are not advisable. Highly organised secret mafia will fulfil everything
    you require. Of course, for the right amount of money.
