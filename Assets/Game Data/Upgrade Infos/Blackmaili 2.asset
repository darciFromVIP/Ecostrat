  description: "You have already learned to use pressure on those who try to pretend
    that no climate change is happening and that humanity is progressing as it should.
    It becomes a problem if someone finds your name at the end of an email or letter
    written by you. That\u2019s exactly why you need a person for such filth, so
    the unnecessary threat doesn\u2019t cost you the chance to save the planet. Adam
    Plutoe, local bouncer and anarchist, already has some experience with this. He
    is always annoyed with the system, and a few nasty letters have already passed
    through his hands. Based on his police record, he should be an easy victim, but
    for a decent financial reward he will take the risk for you."
