  description: "You finally caught the attention of those who pretended that nothing
    was happening. Now you need more people in the streets, more shouting and mischief,
    so they don\u2019t think they are the only dangerous ones. The state is ultimately
    run by the people, and if you get more people into every major state in the world,
    a change in more than one of them will be inevitable. That\u2019s why you need
    more people, more organisers and as many followers as possible."
