  description: "WHN are amazing, but they don\u2019t have the technology that you
    require for hacking the biggest corporations that are causing the worst. You
    found a group of veterans from the US Marines, who served the US so long they
    became disgusted with the things they had to do for the American corporations.
    They offer you their service as a secret elite group of hackers."
