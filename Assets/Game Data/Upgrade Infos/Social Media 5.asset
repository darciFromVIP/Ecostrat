  description: "Cooperation with other corporations works well, but there\u2019s
    something else that interests people even more. Influencers! The last step is
    to create a team that can work with them. For that you\u2019ll need an even bigger
    budget, because no famous influencer will promote something without a fat amount
    of cash."
